# RuneLitePlus-PS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runelite-extended/runelite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/runelite-extended/runelite) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/373382904769675265.svg)](https://discord.gg/HN5gf3m)

[RuneLitePlus-PS](https://runelitepl.us)  is a fork of [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite) that provides more functionality and less restrictions while staying open source. This is specific version meant for rs-mod which can be found here:  
https://www.rune-server.ee/runescape-development/rs2-server/downloads/684206-180-rs-mod-release.html

## Usage

It's ran much like RuneLite or RuneLitePlus, install then run RuneLite.main()  

First you will want to use [Recaf](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/releases) to modify the RSA class (currently cm.class for 180) <clinit> instructions for the server keys you use in the vanilla-RSVERSION.jar in the root of the project. I will implement mixins but this works for now.
